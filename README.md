Hi, these are the mobile apps I have currently built using the flutter SDK.

First, we have a regular pomodoro app that uses the famous pomodoro study method and allows you to track your time working or studdying as well as changing the length of your pomodoros.

Secondly, we have a regular texting app that uses firebase to store its users as well as to implement a realtime database that allows realtime texting.

Thirdly, we have ClockCup, an app where there are different types of ChatRooms based on different themes. Here, people can create a ChatRoom with a specific theme and people with that same interest can join that ChatRoom, allowing people with similiar interests to connect. This app is still a work in progress and hasn't been finished yet.
